## Hey!

I'm Vaibhav Jhingran. I live in Berlin.

I enjoy writing code and building scalable, performant software services.

I mostly like to program in ruby, python. I'm currently exploring clojure and occassionally write elementary scheme.

I currently work as a Senior Backend Engineer at Babbel GmbH.

I enjoy reading, playing my guitar and listening to classic rock and blues.
