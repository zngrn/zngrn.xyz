## Hey!
&nbsp;  
My name is Vaibhav Jhingran. I usually go by the pseudonym ```zngrn``` online. I live in Berlin.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
I enjoy writing code and building scalable, performant software systems.
&nbsp;  
I mostly like to program in ```ruby```, ```python``` or ```typescript```. I'm currently exploring ```clojure``` and occassionally write some amount of elementary ```scheme```.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
I currently work as a Senior Backend Engineer at [Babbel GmbH](https://babbel.com).
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
I enjoy reading, playing my guitar and listening to classic rock & blues.
