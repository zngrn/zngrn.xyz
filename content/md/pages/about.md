## Hey!


My name is Vaibhav Jhingran. I usually go by the pseudonym ```zngrn``` online. I live in Berlin, Germany.


I enjoy writing code and building distributed, scalable & performant software systems.


I work at [Babbel GmbH](https://babbel.com) as a Senior Software Engineer with a focus on backend and distributed systems.


I mostly like to program in ```ruby```, ```python```, ```clojure```  or ```typescript```. I occassionally write some amount of elementary ```scheme```. And I'm trying my hand at ```elisp``` to power up my ```emacs``` usage.


You can find my notes on using ```emacs``` [here](https://github.com/zngrn/emacs-guide).


I like to read, play guitar, walk & cycle around Berlin and chill at [Tempelhofer Feld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempelhofer_Feld).
